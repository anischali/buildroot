# mwifiex driver does not support ap mode natively
# so we need just to bring up the wlan0 and create
# a virtual interface uap0 for the access point.
# launching hostapd on the native wireless card
# will lead to the the issue reported in the link
# below https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215836
# and this corresponds to what indicated by linux wireless
# maintainers group in the documentation below
